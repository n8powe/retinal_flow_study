# retinal_flow

**This project contains the codebase for post-processing and analysis of eye tracking and neural recording data collected from freely moving Macaques in a constrained environment.**

# Downloading code requirements
* python version?
* requirements file [run python -m requirements.txt from vir env.] etc. 

# Description of the task
* What were the macaques doing?
*  Fixation task
*  Movement task
*  etc.

# Data Description

## Downloading Data

*Probably a link to the data that requires explicit access or emailing one of the authors*


# Running the analyses

*Make different section for each analysis*

## Eye tracking analysis

*Descriptive statistics about gaze behavior*

## Retinal Flow Analysis

*Description of retinal flow analysis/visualization*

### Curl & Divergence signals

## Description of neural recording data

*Description of how analyses were conducted* 

**Correct these brain areas recorded from if incorrect**
