# Processing pipeline

Data should be processed in order: (1) Eye, (2) Scene, (3) Retinocentric, (4) Posture (including head) and (5) Neural data.
All data is resampled at 1kHz.

## Eye
1. Extract frames
2. Detect pupil
3. Resample data and fill missing frames

## Scene
1. Extract frames
2. Detect Arucos in calibration frames
3. Rectify videos from fixed calibration
4. Resample data and fill missing frames
5. Compute head-centric optic-flow

## Retinocentric
1. Compute eye-calibration from pupil position, aruco position and calibration file
2. Project rectified scene images into retinal coordinate
4. Compute retino-centric optic-flow

## Posture
1. Get limbs position from deeplabcut
2. Compute 3D position of limbs from stereo
3. Get head-position from Optitrack
4. Get inertial measurements from headstage
5. Fuse head-position, intertial measurement and skeletal model

## Neural data
1. Spike-sorting (Kilosort)
2. TBD
